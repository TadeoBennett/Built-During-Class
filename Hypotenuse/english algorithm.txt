//input h, a, b
If a is not provided or is 0, 
assign a to the missing side value m
assign b to given side's value g
else 
assign a to given side's value g
assign b to missing side value m

assign h the value of itself squared
assign g the value of iself squared
find the difference of h and g and assign the result to d
find the square root of d and assign the value to m
return m  as the answer

if a is 0
check if m is greater than the square root of g
if yes then print "a is longer than b"
else print "b is longer than a"
else if b is 0
check if m is greater than the square root of g
if yes then print "b is longer than a"
else print "a is longer than b"
